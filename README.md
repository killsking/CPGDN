This code is for FPGDN (Exploring Fuzzy Priors From Multi-Mapping GAN for Robust Image Dehazing). 

You can find more details from 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11192256'.

The proposed method is heavily dependent on GPDN https://github.com/yangxy/GPEN.

It should be pointed out that the Outdoor clean images from REISDE contain haze, which may result in the trained model being unable to remove haze completely in real haze images. 

We will upload a dataset, which is used to fine-tune the proposed model for real haze images.
